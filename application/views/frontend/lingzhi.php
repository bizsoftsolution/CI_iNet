						</div>
						
						
							<p style="font-family: inherit;font-size: 15px;text-align:justify">During this process of detoxification. Water soluble toxins (e.g. sugar, uric acid) find the exit through urine and sweat. Fat soluble toxins (e.g. cholesterol) are easily disposed through phlegm. During the detoxification phase the sometimes body feels hot and thirsty. This is sign that the body needs more water to discharge the toxins.</p>
							
						
							<p style="font-family: inherit;font-size: 15px;text-align:justify">Sleep and eating times are most important. When you are healing, your body uses energy to self-restore. If you eat late (after8pm) it will use that energy to digest your food instead. The healing process occurs between 11pm-2am, while you are (or should be) in deep sleep. If your body systems are not in.</p>
